This repository provides a portion of the raw data used in our study on Dynamic Disordering in Discrete States: Disconnected Hopping Boosts Anharmonicity in CuInP2S6.

The current release includes selected simulation outputs, structural models, and processed thermodynamic properties that support the main results reported in our manuscript.

The corresponding calculation scripts, analysis codes, and workflow examples will be made publicly available in a future update once the full data curation process is completed.
